# Pseudocode for longest-string challenge
**by Jeff George, 10.2.15, for DBC Phase 0, Ch. 4.6.4**

For this challenge, I didn't create pseudocode. The solution was identical to the solution for the shortest-string challenge, except for switching a "<" to a ">". I simply copy-pasted my code from shortest-string, copy-pasted "longest" in place of "shortest", and reversed the "<" in the conditional. Voila.
