I need a JavaScript program that will perform three different mathematical functions on a set of integers. The program must be able to handle sets of any size, and the sets may include an even or odd number of members. The members of the set may or may not be in numeric order when entered into the function. The program must perform the following functions on these sets of integers:

SUM
The program must accept a set of whole numbers, and find the sum of all of its members. For example, if the set is (3,5,8,9), the SUM will equal 3+5+8+9, or 25.

MEAN
The program must accept a set of whole numbers, and find the MEAN of those numbers. The MEAN will be equal to the SUM of the members of the set, divided by the quantity of members in the set. The result of the MEAN function may be a number with a decimal fraction of any length. For example, in a set of (2, 5, 8, 9), the MEAN equals (3+5+8+9)/4, or 6.25.

MEDIAN
The program must accept a set of whole numbers, and find the MEDIAN of those numbers. In general, the MEDIAN of a set is the number in the middle of the set when its members are arranged in order from smallest to largest. In the case of a set with an odd number of members, the MEDIAN will be defined as the number in the middle of the ordered set, with an equal number of members smaller than itself and larger than itself. For example, if the set is (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the MEDIAN will be 3.

In the case of a set with an even number of members, the MEDIAN will be the value half-way between the values of the largest member of the smaller half of the ordered set, and the smallest member of larger half of the set. For example, if the set is (1, 2, 3, 4), the MEDIAN will be 2.5.
