# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

To begin with, I spent longer on this assignment than I should have -- which is evidence that I need to work on the exact content of the research in my own life. I have difficulty making myself skim and survey multiple resources on a topic; either I'm interested in it, in which case I read each resource fully instead of skimming for highlights, or I'm not interested, in which case I breeze over the content so quickly and casually that I don't retain anything. These are obviously focus and time-management skills and habits I need to improve.

In general, these resources focused on...well...focus, as well as improving time management and productivity through building better habits and understanding how humans approach tasks. I'd encountered the concept of flow previously, though I'd never seen it connected to hyperfocus before. Hyperfocus is definitely a trait I often exhibit, becoming engrossed in an activity to the point that I don't take a break for many hours in a row. Many times, I've sat down at the computer after putting my daughter to bed, gotten involved in a project, and suddenly realized it was morning when the dog started crying to go out at sunrise. When I'm really engaged in a task, I have very little awareness of the passage of time...is this (good) flow, or (bad) hyperfocus? You tell me...

I generally liked the strategy of breaking things down into small, achievable chunks, a theme which was raised in many of the resources. I dug out an old kitchen timer and put it on my desk to try out Pomodoro. The hardest part is stopping at 25 minutes for the break, no matter what -- that bell breaks flow, but maybe that's a good thing. It certainly causes you to think about your task in half-hour chunks, instead of as a monolithic, all-day or all-week endeavor. And when building new habits, I really liked (and will attempt to implement) the strategy of taking inconvenient or unappealing responsibilities, starting with their minimum viable version (floss one tooth!), and attaching them to an existing behavior or habit. I will try to use this strategy to build habits in meditation, exercise, and daily responsibilities.

I'll continue to ruminate on these ideas, and perhaps post back when I've seen how they can affect my life, routines, and productivity.
