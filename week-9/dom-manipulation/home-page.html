My partner on this challenge was Aaron Tsai.
This challenge took us about half an hour to complete, and I spent another
half hour on my own, following up and reflecting.

What did you learn about the DOM?

The DOM (Document Object Model) is the means by which JavaScript is able to
manipulate the content of a website. In the DOM, the window serves as the
root object in a tree-like, hierarchical structure associated with a browser
session. The first-level child objects of the window include the history (an
array of previously-visited URLs), the current location, and the document,
which is a representation of an HTML or XML document. Within the document are
nodes, including element nodes and text nodes, which correspond to the
elements and text blocks described in the HTML document, and a document node,
which represents the entire document.

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM?

Elements within the DOM may be accessed using a variety of similar-looking
methods, including getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), and
getElementsByTagName(). Methods that enable us to add, remove, or alter
elements in the DOM include .style, .innerHTML, .className, and .appendChild.
