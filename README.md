# Phase 0

Assignments for Dev Bootcamp's Phase 0, completed between August and November of 2015. Phase 0 is the 9-week-long remote course which prepares students for Dev Bootcamp's 9-week on-campus Web Development Immersive program. Phase 0 introduces students to HTML, CSS, Ruby and Javascript, as well as basic CS concepts. Most assignments in this repo include instructions and reflections, and offer a fairly complete view of my experiences during Phase 0.
