### By Jeff George, 9.24.15, for DBC Phase 0

#### How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?



#### How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?




#### What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?




#### What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?




#### What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
