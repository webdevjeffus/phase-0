## Reflection Questions

#### What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

1. **Information gathering** - Identify the site's purpose, goals, target audience, and content
2. **Planning** - Layout the site's structure in a site map, and make technical decisions regarding tools and frameworks
3. **Design** - Create a look and feel for the site that is appropriate to its purpose, content, and target audience
4. **Development** - Create the actual website, including all components such as apps or e-commerce functionality
5. **Testing and Delivery** - Test the site's functionality, stability and user experience; when all aspects are approved, upload all files to the server and go live
6. **Maintenance** - Add or update content, improve user experience, fix bugs, perform backups, etc.

#### What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary goal of this website is present myself as a professional web developer to potential employers and clients, by...
* hosting an online portfolio of my work
* providing an indexed collection of technical and professional blog posts
* listing skills, work history, and contact information.

#### What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

The primary target audience for this site is potential employers and clients, who will visit the site to samples of my work, information about my professional experience, and a sense of my thought processes and opinions from my blog posts.

The secondary target audience are other web developers, particularly emerging developers, who may take an interest in blog topics including technical overviews and how-tos, observations on trends in web development, and my experiences as a bootcamp student and eventually as a junior dev.

#### What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

My intent is that visitors of all types - including employers, clients, and web dev peers - will find the content of my site interesting enough to cause them to contact me. Hopefully, employers and clients will take an interest in my portfolio, and other devs will be interested enough in the blog posts to respond, either via comments or email.

#### What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience? What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

_(Note: I addressed questions 6 and 7, concerning UX, together in a single, extended answer.)_

User experience, or UX, is the overall feeling or reaction that users experience when interacting with a website, and it affected by diverse factors including (but not limited to) ease of use; value and relevance of content; quality, appeal and appropriateness of visual design; website speed and functionality, etc. If any of these factors is not properly conceived, designed, and executed, the overall UX will suffer, no matter how well the other factors perform. For example, the website that serves account holders in a bank may be fast, functional, and intuitive, but if it's designed with a multi-colored, circus clown visual metaphor, the user experience will suffer, which will cause users to leave the site quickly, and take their attention and business elsewhere. UX designers will coordinate with clients, designers, developers, testers, and users, using a variety of tools and tests, to assure that all aspects of the website work together to create a positive user experience.

#### Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Tedious? Interesting that the question is posed that way... The actual work in the challenge -- creating a site layout, pushing it to GitHub, and making it available through this document -- was neither difficult nor time consuming, once I'd chosen an appropriate tool to actually construct the map. (After trying the free version of WriteMaps, I decided I'd prefer to work with the shape-drawing functionality of MS Word!) In fact, the most tedious portion of this challenge was answering these questions to prove that I at least skimmed the linked websites, when what I really want to be doing is moving onto the real work in the next challenge. (Sorry to be blunt, but you asked...)
